Hi, this is my version of the solved tasks and the notes I will make through out the course of this book.
I try to update my programs and upload my progress.

Note: If you notize any misspelling let me know, because english is not my native language.

Then why is it in english and not your native language?
1.Because I own a english book and not a translated one.
2. I didn't want to get a book with possible translation errors
3. I've also heard that reading in another language helps you concentrate better
